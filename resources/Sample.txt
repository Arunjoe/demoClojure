Write a function that takes the following parameters:
A string (sentence)
A list/array of strings (words)
The function should return all of the words from the second parameter (words) that can be 
composed using the *characters* from the first parameter.
The only restriction is that once a character from the sentence has been used, it cannot be used again.
